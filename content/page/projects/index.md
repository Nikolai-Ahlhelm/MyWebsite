## Powershell Projects

All Powershell projects

---

### Nikolais-Powershell-Library

This library aims to simplify functions that are often but hard to use.
The library is split in modules, where each module contains one feature/function.

For example:
- Ballontip module - e.g. you can call this `BallonError(title,text,timeout)` to see a error ballontip

### [Loggin Module](https://github.com/Nikolai-Ahlhelm/Logging-Module-for-Powershell)

This powershell module is an all-in-one solution for logging.

It has different logtypes and logmodes:
| **Type**       | **Short** | **INFO** | **WARNING** | **CRITICAL** | **ERROR** | **DEBUG** |
|----------------|-----------|----------|-------------|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| **DEFAULT**    | DEF       |     X    |      X      |       X      |     X     |           |
| **DEBUG**      | DBG       |     X    |      X      |       X      |     X     |     X     |
| **PRODUCTIVE** | PROD      |     X    |             |       X      |     X     |           |
| **ERROR**      | ERR       |          |             |              |     X     |           |
| **CRITICAL**   | CRIT      |          |             |       X      |           |           |

Currently version 3.0 is in work, with this new version there will be:
- Automatic log cleaning (removes log files older than x)
- Switch between short and full timestamps
- XML config file
- Default log file name (if not specified)
- (Colored log output, e.g. error messages are red)
